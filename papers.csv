New long-read sequencing technologies can sequence the entire 16S rRNA gene, but higher error rates have limited their attractiveness when accuracy is important. Here we present a high-throughput amplicon sequencing methodology based on PacBio circular consensus sequencing and the DADA2 sample inference method that measures the full-length 16S rRNA gene with single-nucleotide resolution and a near-zero error rate.                        In two artificial communities of known composition, our method recovered the full complement of full-length 16S sequence variants from expected community members without residual errors. The measured abundances of intra-genomic sequence variants were in the integral ratios expected from the genuine allelic variants within a genome. The full-length 16S gene sequences recovered by our approach allowed             E. coli             strains to be correctly classified to the O157:H7 and K12 sub-species clades. In human fecal samples, our method showed strong technical replication and was able to recover the full complement of 16S rRNA alleles in several             E. coli             strains.                      There are likely many applications beyond microbial profiling for which high-throughput amplicon sequencing of complete genes with single-nucleotide resolution will be of use.","2018-08-15","2019-10-29 14:33:18","2019-10-30 12:21:54","2019-10-29 14:33:18","","","","","","","","","","","","Bioinformatics","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/392332 Citation Key Alias: CallahanHighthroughputampliconsequencing2018","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/2QIMPE4M/Callahan et al_2018_High-throughput amplicon sequencing of the full-length 16S rRNA gene with.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although many scientific questions can be addressed with broad taxonomic profiles, clinical, food safety, and some ecological applications require higher specificity. Here we introduce a novel sub-operational-taxonomic-unit (sOTU) approach, Deblur, that uses error profiles to obtain putative error-free sequences from Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq sequencing platforms. Deblur substantially reduces computational demands relative to similar sOTU methods and does so with similar or better sensitivity and specificity. Using simulations, mock mixtures, and real data sets, we detected closely related bacterial sequences with single nucleotide differences while removing false positives and maintaining stability in detection, suggesting that Deblur is limited only by read length and diversity within the amplicon sequences. Because Deblur operates on a per-sample level, it scales to modern data sets and meta-analyses. To highlight Deblur’s ability to integrate data sets, we include an interactive exploration of its application to multiple distinct sequencing rounds of the American Gut Project. Deblur is open source under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license, easily installable, and downloadable from               https://github.com/biocore/deblur               .                                         IMPORTANCE               Deblur provides a rapid and sensitive means to assess ecological patterns driven by differentiation of closely related taxa. This algorithm provides a solution to the problem of identifying real ecological differences between taxa whose amplicons differ by a single base pair, is applicable in an automated fashion to large-scale sequencing data sets, and can integrate sequencing runs collected over time.","2017-04-25","2019-10-29 14:33:31","2019-10-29 14:33:31","2019-10-29 14:33:31","e00191-16, /msys/2/2/e00191-16.atom","","2","2","","mSystems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/EUI52FKT/Amir et al_2017_Deblur Rapidly Resolves Single-Nucleotide Community Sequence Patterns.pdf","","","","Gilbert, Jack A.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But the measurements they provide differ from the truth, often dramatically, because these experiments are biased toward detecting some taxa over others. This experimental bias makes the taxon or gene abundances measured by different protocols quantitatively incomparable and can lead to spurious biological conclusions. We propose a mathematical model for how bias distorts community measurements based on the properties of real experiments. We validate this model with 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomics data from defined bacterial communities. Our model better fits the experimental data despite being simpler than previous models. We illustrate how our model can be used to evaluate protocols, to understand the effect of bias on downstream statistical analyses, and to measure and correct bias given suitable calibration controls. These results illuminate new avenues toward truly quantitative and reproducible metagenomics measurements.","2019-09-10","2019-10-29 14:34:14","2019-10-29 14:34:14","2019-10-29 14:34:14","e46923","","","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/47YD4PWU/McLaren et al_2019_Consistent and correctable bias in metagenomic sequencing experiments.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While many studies have focused on the effect of individual microbial taxa, the metabolic potential of the entire gut microbial ecosystem has been largely under-explored. We characterised the gut microbiome of 1,004 twins via whole shotgun metagenomic sequencing (average 39M reads per sample). We observed greater similarity, across unrelated individuals, for functional metabolic pathways (82%) than for taxonomic composition (43%). We conducted a microbiota-wide association study linking both taxonomic information and microbial metabolic pathways with 673 blood and 713 faecal metabolites (Metabolon, Inc.). Metabolic pathways associated with 34% of blood and 95% of faecal metabolites, with over 18,000 significant associations, while species-level results identified less than 3,000 associations, suggesting that coordinated action of multiple taxa is required to affect the metabolome. Finally, we estimated that the microbiome mediated a crosstalk between 71% of faecal and 15% of blood metabolites, highlighting six key species (unclassified Subdoligranulum spp., Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, Roseburia inulinivorans, Methanobrevibacter smithii, Eubacterium rectale, and Akkermansia muciniphila). Because of the large inter-person variability in microbiome composition, our results underline the importance of studying gut microbial metabolic pathways rather than focusing purely on taxonomy to find therapeutic and diagnostic targets.","2019-02-27","2019-10-29 14:37:22","2019-10-30 12:30:38","2019-10-29 14:37:22","","","","","","","","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/561787 Citation Key Alias: ViscontiInterplayhumangut2019","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/DFU5VHLD/Visconti et al_2019_Interplay between the human gut microbiome and host metabolism.pdf","","human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the data used for profiling microbial communities is usually low in signal and high in noise preventing the identification of real differences among treatments. PIME (Prevalence Interval for Microbiome Evaluation) fills this gap by removing those taxa that may be high in relative abundance in just a few samples but have a low prevalence overall. The reliability and robustness of PIME were compare against the existing methods and verified by a number of approaches using 16S rRNA independent datasets. To remove the noise, PIME filters microbial taxa not shared in a per treatment prevalence interval starting at 5% with increments of 5% at each filtering step. For each prevalence interval, hundreds of decision trees are calculated to predict the likelihood of detecting differences in treatments. The best prevalence-filtered dataset is user-selected by choosing the prevalence interval that keeps the majority of the 16S rRNA reads in the dataset and shows the lowest error rate. To obtain the likelihood of introducing bias while building prevalence-filtered datasets, an error detection step based in random permutations is also included. A reanalysis of previews published datasets with PIME uncovered previously missed microbial associations improving the ability to detect important organisms, which may be masked when only relative abundance is considered.","2019-05-09","2019-10-29 14:37:41","2019-10-30 12:23:24","2019-10-29 14:37:41","","","","","","","PIME","","","","","Bioinformatics","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/632182 Citation Key Alias: RoeschPIMEpackagediscovery2019a","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/DQIGPJ33/Roesch et al_2019_PIME.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is an analytical technique commonly used by metabolomics labs to measure hundreds of metabolites of known identity and thousands of “peaks” from yet to be identified compounds that are tracked by their measured masses and chromatographic retention times.               netome               is a computational framework that provides tools for analyzing processed LC-MS data. In this framework, we develop and provide various computational resources including individual software modules to inspect and adjust trends in raw data, align unknown peaks between separately acquired data sets, and to remove redundancies in nontargeted LC-MS data arising from multiple ionization products of a single metabolite. These tools are deployed through computing resources such as web servers and virtual machines with detailed documentation in order to support researchers.

Each individual tool is available with source code, workshop-oriented documentation which includes instructions for installation and using tools with demonstration examples, and a web server with all services. We also provide a complete image of the               netome               package with all pre-installed dependencies and support for Google Compute Engine and Amazon EC2.

A drawback of these approaches is that the necessary sequencing library preparation and bioinformatic analyses are complicated and continuously changing, which can be a barrier for researchers new to the field. We present three essential components to conducting a microbiome experiment from start to finish: first, a simplified and step-by-step custom gene sequencing protocol that requires limited lab equipment, is cost-effective, and has been thoroughly tested and utilized on various sample types; second, a series of scripts to integrate various commonly used bioinformatic tools that is available as a standalone installation or as a single downloadable virtual image; and third, a set of bioinformatic workflows and tutorials to provide step-by-step guidance and education for those new to the microbiome field. This resource will provide the foundations for those newly entering the microbiome field and will provide much-needed guidance and best practices to ensure that quality microbiome research is undertaken. All protocols, scripts, workflows, tutorials, and virtual images are freely available through the Microbiome Helper website (               https://github.com/mlangill/microbiome_helper/wiki               ).

We outline here a streamlined and custom approach to processing samples from detailed sequencing library construction to step-by-step bioinformatic standard operating procedures. This allows for rapid and reliable microbiome analysis, allowing researchers to focus more on their experiment design and results. Our sequencing protocols, bioinformatic tutorials, and bundled software are freely available through Microbiome Helper.

Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or microbial composition of communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. Common approaches use a notion of 97% similarity and normalize the data by subsampling to equalize library sizes. In this paper, we show that statistical models allow more accurate abundance estimates. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, including both parameteric and nonparametric methods. We provide examples of using the               R                packages dada2, phyloseq, DESeq2, ggplot2 and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data.

We performed a prospective longitudinal study of perimenarcheal girls to gain insight into the timing and sequence of changes that occur in the vaginal and vulvar microbiota during puberty. The study enrolled 31 healthy, premenarcheal girls between the ages of 10 and 12 years and collected vaginal and vulvar swabs quarterly for up to 3 years. Bacterial composition was characterized by Roche 454 pyrosequencing and classification of regions V1 to V3 of 16S rRNA genes. Contrary to expectations, lactic acid bacteria, primarily Lactobacillus spp., were dominant in the microbiota of most girls well before the onset of menarche in the early to middle stages of puberty.               Gardnerella vaginalis               was detected at appreciable levels in approximately one-third of subjects, a notable finding considering that this organism is commonly associated with bacterial vaginosis in adults. Vulvar microbiota closely resembled vaginal microbiota but often exhibited additional taxa typically associated with skin microbiota. Our findings suggest that the vaginal microbiota of girls begin to resemble those of adults well before the onset of menarche.                                         IMPORTANCE               This study addresses longitudinal changes in vaginal and vulvar microbial communities prior to and immediately following menarche. The research is significant because microbial ecology of the vagina is an integral aspect of health, including resistance to infections. The physiologic changes of puberty and initiation of cyclic menstruation are likely to have profound effects on vaginal microbiota, but almost nothing is known about changes that normally occur during this time. Our understanding has been especially hampered by the lack of thorough characterization of microbial communities using techniques that do not rely on the cultivation of fastidious bacteria, as well as a dearth of studies on girls in the early to middle stages of puberty. This study improves our understanding of the normal development of vaginal microbiota during puberty and onset of menarche and may better inform clinical approaches to vulvovaginal care of adolescent girls.                        ,              This study addresses longitudinal changes in vaginal and vulvar microbial communities prior to and immediately following menarche.

In this study, the spatial and temporal dynamics of the bacterial communities associated with grapevine organs (leaves, flowers, grapes, and roots) and soils were characterized over two growing seasons to determine the influence of vine cultivar, edaphic parameters, vine developmental stage (dormancy, flowering, preharvest), and vineyard. Belowground bacterial communities differed significantly from those aboveground, and yet the communities associated with leaves, flowers, and grapes shared a greater proportion of taxa with soil communities than with each other, suggesting that soil may serve as a bacterial reservoir. A subset of soil microorganisms, including root colonizers significantly enriched in plant growth-promoting bacteria and related functional genes, were selected by the grapevine. In addition to plant selective pressure, the structure of soil and root microbiota was significantly influenced by soil pH and C:N ratio, and changes in leaf- and grape-associated microbiota were correlated with soil carbon and showed interannual variation even at small spatial scales. Diazotrophic bacteria, e.g.,               Rhizobiaceae               and Bradyrhizobium spp., were significantly more abundant in soil samples and root samples of specific vineyards. Vine-associated microbial assemblages were influenced by myriad factors that shape their composition and structure, but the majority of organ-associated taxa originated in the soil, and their distribution reflected the influence of highly localized biogeographic factors and vineyard management.                                         IMPORTANCE               Vine-associated bacterial communities may play specific roles in the productivity and disease resistance of their host plant. Also, the bacterial communities on grapes have the potential to influence the organoleptic properties of the wine, contributing to a regional terroir. Understanding that factors that influence these bacteria may provide insights into management practices to shape and craft individual wine properties. We show that soil serves as a key source of vine-associated bacteria and that edaphic factors and vineyard-specific properties can influence the native grapevine microbiome preharvest.                        ,              Vine-associated bacterial communities may play specific roles in the productivity and disease resistance of their host plant.

"FTJEUKM4","document","2017","Duvallet, Claire; Gibbons, Sean; Gurry, Thomas; Irizarry, Rafael; Alm, Eric","Microbiomehd: The Human Gut Microbiome In Health And Disease","","","","","https://zenodo.org/record/797943","<strong>Overview</strong> MicrobiomeHD is a standardized database of human gut microbiome studies in health and disease. This database includes publicly available 16S data from published case-control studies and their associated patient metadata. Raw sequencing data for each study was downloaded and processed through a standardized pipeline. To be included in MicrobiomeHD, datasets have: 	publicly available raw sequencing data (fastq or fasta) 	publicly available metadata with at least case and control labels for each patient 	at least 15 case patients Currently, MicrobiomeHD is focused on stool samples. Additional samples may be included in certain datasets, as indicated in the metadata. <strong>Files</strong> Additional information about the datasets included in this MicrobiomeHD release are in the MicrobiomeHD github repo https://github.com/cduvallet/microbiomeHD, in the file <em>db/dataset_info.yaml</em>. Top-level identifiers correspond to the dataset IDs used in Duvallet et al. 2017. Sample sizes in the yaml file are those that were described in the papers, and may not exactly reflect the actual data (due to missing/extra data, samples which didn't pass quality control, etc). Each dataset was downloaded and processed through a standardized pipeline. The raw processing results are available in the *.tar.gz files here. Each file has the same directory structure and files, as described in the pipeline documentation: http://amplicon-sequencing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/output.html. Specific files of interest include: 	<strong>summary_file.txt</strong>: this file contains a summary of all parameters used to process the data 	<strong>datasetID.metadata.txt</strong>: the metadata associated with the samples. Note that some samples in the metadata may not have sequencing data, and vice versa. 	<strong>RDP/datasetID.otu_table.100.denovo.rdp_assigned</strong>: the 100% OTU tables with Latin taxonomic names assigned using the RDP classifier. 	<strong>datasetID.otu_seqs.100.fasta</strong>: representative sequences for each OTU in the 100% OTU table. OTU labels in the OTU table end with d__denovoID - these denovoIDs correspond to the sequences in this file. Processing The raw data was acquired as described in the supplementary materials of Duvallet et al.'s ""Meta analysis of microbiome studies identifies shared and disease-specific patterns"". Raw sequencing data was processed with the Alm lab's in-house 16S processing pipeline: https://github.com/thomasgurry/amplicon_sequencing_pipeline Pipeline documentation is available at: http://amplicon-sequencing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/ Metadata was extracted from the original papers and/or data sources, and formatted manually. <strong>Contributing</strong> MicrobiomeHD is a resource that can be used to extract disease-specific microbiome signals in individual case-control studies. Many microbes respond non-specifically to health and disease, and the majority of bacterial associations within individual studies overlap with this ""core"" response. Researchers should cross-check their results with the data presented here to ensure that their identified microbial associations are specific to their disease under study. We provide an updated list of ""core"" microbes here, as well as the raw OTU tables for anyone who wishes to reproduce and adapt this analysis to their study question. If you would like to include your case-control dataset in MicrobiomeHD, please email duvallet[at]mit.edu. For us to process your data through our standard pipeline, you will need to provide the following files and information about your data: 	raw sequencing data in fastq or fasta format (preferably fastq) 	information about which processing steps will be required (e.g. removing primers or barcodes, merging paired-end reads, etc) 	sample IDs associated with the sequencing data (either mapped to barcodes still in the sequences, or to each de-multiplexed sequencing file) 	case/control metadata of each sample 	other relevant metadata (e.g. sampling site, if not all samples are stool; sampling time point, if multiple samples per patient were taken; etc) By using MicrobiomeHD in your own analyses, you agree to contribute your dataset to this database and to make your raw sequencing data (i.e. fastq files) publicly available. <strong>Citing MicrobiomeHD</strong> The MicrobiomeHD database and original publications for each of these datasets are described in Duvallet et al. (2017): http://biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/05/08/134031 If you use any of these datasets in your analysis, please cite both MicrobiomeHD (Duvallet et al. (2017)) and the original publication for each dataset that you use. The code used to process and analyze this data in Duvallet et al. (2017) is available on github: https://github.com/cduvallet/microbiomeHD <strong>Files</strong> <em>Core genera</em> <strong>file-S3.core_genera.txt</strong>: Supplemental Table 3 from Duvallet et al. (2017), listing the core health- and disease-associated microbes. <em>Datasets</em> Note that MicrobiomeHD contains all 28 datasets from Duvallet et al. (2017), as well as additional datasets which did not meet the inclusion criteria for the meta-analysis presented in the paper. Additional information about the datasets included in this MicrobiomeHD release are in the original publications and the MicrobiomeHD github repo https://github.com/cduvallet/microbiomeHD, in the file <em>db/dataset_info.yaml</em>. The sample sizes listed here reflect what was reported in the original publications. Some may have discrepancies between what is reported and what is in the actual data due to missing data, quality issues, barcode mismatches, etc. 	<strong>asd_son_results.tar.gz</strong>

Most of the routinely measured traits tended to show a significant phylogenetic signal, although this signal was weak for environmental preferences. We demonstrated how this database could be used to link genomic attributes to differences in pH and salinity optima. We found that adaptations to high salinity or high-pH conditions are related to cell surface transporter genes, along with previously uncharacterized genes that might play a role in regulating environmental tolerances. Together, this work highlights the utility of this database for associating bacterial taxonomy, phylogeny, or specific genes to measured phenotypic traits and emphasizes the need for more comprehensive and consistent measurements of traits across a broader diversity of bacteria.

Invertons containing promoters often regulate extracellular products, underscoring the importance of surface diversity for gut colonization. We found invertons containing promoters regulating antibiotic resistance genes that shift to the ON orientation after antibiotic treatment in human metagenomic data and in vitro, thereby mitigating the cost of antibiotic resistance. We observed that the orientations of some invertons diverge after fecal microbiota transplant, potentially as a result of individual-specific selective forces.","2019-01-11","2019-10-29 14:44:17","2019-10-29 14:44:17","2019-10-29 14:44:17","181-187","","6423","363","","Science","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/GWVSLSSZ/Jiang et al_2019_Invertible promoters mediate bacterial phase variation, antibiotic resistance,.pdf","","human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, our ability to identify the specific features of a microbiome that differentiate these community-level patterns have lagged behind, especially as ever-cheaper DNA sequencing has yielded increasingly large data sets. One critical gap is the ability to search for samples that contain specific features (for example, sub-operational taxonomic units [sOTUs] identified by high-resolution statistical methods for removing amplicon sequencing errors). Here we introduce redbiom, a microbiome caching layer, which allows users to rapidly query samples that contain a given feature, retrieve sample data and metadata, and search for samples that match specified metadata values or ranges (e.g., all samples with a pH of >7), implemented using an in-memory NoSQL database called Redis. By default, redbiom allows public anonymous sample access for over 100,000 publicly available samples in the Qiita database. At over 100,000 samples, the caching server requires only 35 GB of resident memory. We highlight how redbiom enables a new type of characterization of microbiome samples and provide tutorials for using redbiom with QIIME 2. redbiom is open source under the BSD license, hosted on GitHub, and can be deployed independently of Qiita to enable search of proprietary or clinically restricted microbiome databases.                            IMPORTANCE               Although analyses that combine many microbiomes at the whole-community level have become routine, searching rapidly for microbiomes that contain a particular sequence has remained difficult. The software we present here, redbiom, dramatically accelerates this process, allowing samples that contain microbiome features to be rapidly identified. This is especially useful when taxonomic annotation is limited, allowing users to identify environments in which unannotated microbes of interest were previously observed. This approach also allows environmental or clinical factors that correlate with specific features, or vice versa, to be identified rapidly, even at a scale of billions of sequences in hundreds of thousands of samples. The software is integrated with existing analysis tools to enable fast, large-scale microbiome searches and discovery of new microbiome relationships.","2019-06-25","2019-10-29 14:44:18","2019-10-29 14:44:18","2019-10-29 14:44:18","e00215-19, /msystems/4/4/mSys.00215-19.atom","","4","4","","mSystems","redbiom","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/3KVC9ZQC/McDonald et al_2019_redbiom.pdf","","","","Chu, Haiyan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taxonomic identification software usually align individual short sequence reads to a reference database, sometimes containing taxa with complete genomes only. This is a challenging task given that different species can share identical sequence regions and complete genome sequences are only available for a fraction of organisms. A recently developed approach to map sequence reads to reference databases involves weighing all high scoring read-mappings to the data base as a whole to produce better-informed alignments. We used this novel concept in read mapping to develop a highly accurate metagenomic classification pipeline named CCMetagen. Using simulated fungal and bacterial metagenomes, we demonstrate that CCMetagen substantially outperforms other commonly used metagenome classifiers, attaining a 3 – 1580 fold increase in precision and a 2 – 922 fold increase in F1 scores for species-level classifications when compared to Kraken2, Centrifuge and KrakenUniq. CCMetagen is sufficiently fast and memory efficient to use the entire NCBI nucleotide collection (nt) as reference, enabling the assessment of species with incomplete genome sequence data from all biological kingdoms. Our pipeline efficiently produced a comprehensive overview of the microbiome of two biological data sets, including both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. CCMetagen is user-friendly and the results can be easily integrated into microbial community analysis software for streamlined and automated microbiome studies.","2019-05-17","2019-10-29 14:44:31","2019-10-30 12:22:55","2019-10-29 14:44:31","","","","","","","CCMetagen","","","","","Bioinformatics","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/641332 Citation Key Alias: MarcelinoCCMetagencomprehensiveaccurate2019","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/22Y2XMRR/Marcelino et al_2019_CCMetagen.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is designed as an alternative to the widely used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is not publicly available, algorithm details are only rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit version is freely available for academic use.                                         Methods               When searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic based on words shared by the query and target sequences in order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs optimal global sequence alignment of the query against potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH. Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using vectorisation and multiple threads.                                         Results                                VSEARCH includes most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH version 8, including searching (exact or based on global alignment), clustering by similarity (using length pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order), chimera detection (reference-based or                 de novo                 ), dereplication (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with several new commands and improvements, including shuffling, rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling, while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging. VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is available at                 https://github.com/torognes/vsearch                 under either the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License version 3.0.                                                        Discussion               VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast, accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now available to the metagenomics community.","2016-10-18","2019-10-29 14:45:33","2019-10-29 14:45:33","2019-10-29 14:45:33","e2584","","","4","","","VSEARCH","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/GCKNU75U/Rognes et al_2016_VSEARCH.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Despite this, cancer microbiome studies have almost exclusively focused on bacteria instead of viruses. We began evaluating the cancer virome by focusing on colorectal cancer, a primary cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world, and a cancer linked to altered colonic bacterial community compositions but with an unknown association with the gut virome. We used 16S rRNA gene, whole shotgun metagenomic, and purified virus metagenomic sequencing of stool to evaluate the differences in human colorectal cancer virus and bacterial community composition. Through random forest modeling we identified differences in the healthy and colorectal cancer virome. The cancer-associated virome consisted primarily of temperate bacteriophages that were also predicted to be bacteria-virus community network hubs. These results provide foundational evidence that bacteriophage communities are associated with colorectal cancer and potentially impact cancer progression by altering the bacterial host communities.","2017-06-20","2019-10-29 14:46:59","2019-10-30 12:20:07","2019-10-29 14:46:59","","","","","","","","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/152868 Citation Key Alias: HanniganDiagnosticPotentialInteractive2017","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/SEHRILIF/Hannigan et al_2017_The Diagnostic Potential & Interactive Dynamics of the Colorectal Cancer Virome.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, spike-in mock communities have been used to measure accuracy of sequencing platforms and data analysis pipelines. To assess the ability of sequencing platforms and data processing pipelines using fungal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) amplicons, we created two ITS spike-in control mock communities composed of cloned DNA in plasmids: a biological mock community, consisting of ITS sequences from fungal taxa, and a synthetic mock community (SynMock), consisting of non-biological ITS-like sequences. Using these spike-in controls we show that: (1) a non-biological synthetic control (e.g., SynMock) is the best solution for parameterizing bioinformatics pipelines, (2) pre-clustering steps for variable length amplicons are critically important, (3) a major source of bias is attributed to the initial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and thus HTAS read abundances are typically not representative of starting values. We developed AMPtk, a versatile software solution equipped to deal with variable length amplicons and quality filter HTAS data based on spike-in controls. While we describe herein a non-biological SynMock community for ITS sequences, the concept and AMPtk software can be widely applied to any HTAS dataset to improve data quality.","2018-05-28","2019-10-29 14:47:46","2019-10-29 14:47:46","2019-10-29 14:47:46","e4925","","","6","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/U79GC2XE/Palmer et al_2018_Non-biological synthetic spike-in controls and the AMPtk software pipeline.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, analyzing the resulting multi-omics data remains a significant challenge in current studies due to the lack of a comprehensive computational tool to facilitate data integration and interpretation. In this study, we have developed a microbiome and metabolome correlation analysis pipeline (MMCA) to meet the urgent needs for tools that effectively integrate microbiome and metabolome data to derive biological insights.                                   Results                            To make the MMCA pipeline available to a wider research community, we have implemented a web server (               http://mmca.met-bioinformatics.cn               ). MMCA integrates a variety of statistical analysis methods in order to obtain reliable results from multiple analyses, including univariate analysis and multivariate modeling. MMCA also provides KEGG-based functional network analysis in order to investigate their biological interplay between metabolites and microbes. To make it more convenient, an html-based report is available for overview and can be downloaded for later use.                                                Conclusions             MMCA allows users to upload annotated microbiome and metabolome data, provides a user-friendly interface to analyze and visualize the complex interplay between microbiome and metabolome, and helps users to develop mechanistic hypothesis for nutritional and personalized therapies of diseases.","2019-06-21","2019-10-29 14:51:10","2019-10-29 14:51:10","2019-10-29 14:51:09","","","","","","","MMCA","","","","","Bioinformatics","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/678813","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/BB42UVFI/Ni et al_2019_MMCA.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, navigating this set of large and heterogeneous data is challenging, especially for researchers without bioinformatic expertise. Therefore, a user-friendly interface is needed that allows users to visualize and statistically analyse the data.                                   Results             We developed an interactive frontend to facilitate the exploration of the MetaMap resource. The webtool allows users to query the resource by searching study abstracts for keywords or browsing expression patterns for specific metafeatures. Moreover, users can manually define sample groupings or use the existing annotation for downstream analysis. The web tool provides a large variety of analyses and visualizations including dimension reduction, differential abundance analysis and Krona visualizations. The MetaMap webtool represents a valuable resource for hypothesis generation regarding the impact of the microbiome in human disease.

Current existing approaches rely on gene or contig co-abundance information across multiple samples and             k             -mer composition information in the sequences. Here we use recent advances in deep learning to develop an algorithm that uses variational autoencoders to encode co-abundance and compositional information prior to clustering. We show that the deep network is able to integrate these two heterogeneous datasets without any prior knowledge and that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art by reconstructing 1.8 - 8 times more highly precise and complete genome bins from three different benchmark datasets. Additionally, we apply our method to a gene catalogue of almost 10 million genes and 1,270 samples from the human gut microbiome. Here we are able to cluster 1.3 - 1.8 million extra genes and reconstruct 117 - 246 more highly precise and complete bins of which 70 bins were completely new compared to previous methods.

Using standardized protocols from the Earth Microbiome Project and sample contributions from over 10,000 citizen-scientists, together with an open research network, we compare human microbiome specimens primarily from the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia to one another and to environmental samples. Our results show an unexpected range of beta-diversity in human stool microbiomes compared to environmental samples; demonstrate the utility of procedures for removing the effects of overgrowth during room-temperature shipping for revealing phenotype correlations; uncover new molecules and kinds of molecular communities in the human stool metabolome; and examine emergent associations among the microbiome, metabolome, and the diversity of plants that are consumed (rather than relying on reductive categorical variables such as veganism, which have little or no explanatory power). We also demonstrate the utility of the living data resource and cross-cohort comparison to confirm existing associations between the microbiome and psychiatric illness and to reveal the extent of microbiome change within one individual during surgery, providing a paradigm for open microbiome research and education.                            IMPORTANCE               We show that a citizen science, self-selected cohort shipping samples through the mail at room temperature recaptures many known microbiome results from clinically collected cohorts and reveals new ones. Of particular interest is integrating               n               = 1 study data with the population data, showing that the extent of microbiome change after events such as surgery can exceed differences between distinct environmental biomes, and the effect of diverse plants in the diet, which we confirm with untargeted metabolomics on hundreds of samples.","2018-05-15","2019-10-29 14:52:16","2019-10-29 14:52:16","2019-10-29 14:52:16","e00031-18, /msystems/3/3/msys.00031-18.atom","","3","3","","mSystems","American Gut","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/8WRZ8RNK/McDonald et al_2018_American Gut.pdf","","","","Greene, Casey S.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many tools exist to quantify and compare abundance levels or OTU composition of communities in different conditions. The sequencing reads have to be denoised and assigned to the closest taxa from a reference database. Common approaches use a notion of 97% similarity and normalize the data by subsampling to equalize library sizes. In this paper, we show that statistical models allow more accurate abundance estimates. By providing a complete workflow in R, we enable the user to do sophisticated downstream statistical analyses, whether parametric or nonparametric. We provide examples of using the R packages dada2, phyloseq, DESeq2, ggplot2 and vegan to filter, visualize and test microbiome data.

Most previous work has relied on studying bacteria and viruses independently, thereby reducing them to two separate communities. Such approaches are unable to capture how these microbial communities interact, such as through processes that maintain community robustness or allow phage-host populations to co-evolve. We implemented a network-based analytical approach to describe phage-bacteria network diversity throughout the human body. We built these community networks using a machine learning algorithm to predict which phages could infect which bacteria in a given microbiome. Our algorithm was applied to paired viral and bacterial metagenomic sequence sets from three previously published human cohorts. We organized the predicted interactions into networks that allowed us to evaluate phage-bacteria connectedness across the human body. We observed evidence that gut and skin network structures were person-specific and not conserved among cohabitating family members. High-fat diets appeared to be associated with less connected networks. Network structure differed between skin sites, with those exposed to the external environment being less connected and likely more susceptible to network degradation by microbial extinction events. This study quantified and contrasted the diversity of virome-microbiome networks across the human body and illustrated how environmental factors may influence phage-bacteria interactive dynamics. This work provides a baseline for future studies to better understand system perturbations, such as disease states, through ecological networks.                        Author Summary             The human microbiome, the collection of microbial communities that colonize the human body, is a crucial component to health and disease. Two major components of the human microbiome are the bacterial and viral communities. These communities have primarily been studied separately using metrics of community composition and diversity. These approaches have failed to capture the complex dynamics of interacting bacteria and phage communities, which frequently share genetic information and work together to maintain ecosystem homestatsis (e.g. kill-the-winner dynamics). Removal of bacteria or phage can disrupt or even collapse those ecosystems. Relationship-based network approaches allow us to capture this interaction information. Using this network-based approach with three independent human cohorts, we were able to present an initial understanding of how phage-bacteria networks differ throughout the human body, so as to provide a baseline for future studies of how and why microbiome networks differ in disease states.","2017-05-31","2019-10-29 14:54:22","2019-10-30 12:30:38","2019-10-29 14:54:22","","","","","","","","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/144642 Citation Key Alias: HanniganBiogeographyenvironmentalconditions2017a","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/4ISNTKP3/Hannigan et al_2017_Biogeography & environmental conditions shape bacteriophage-bacteria networks.pdf","","human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There are numerous platforms for producing 16S rRNA taxonomic data which often vary in file and sequence formatting, creating a common barrier in microbiome studies. Additionally, many of the methods for analyzing and visualizing this sequencing data each require their own specific formatting. As a result, efficient and reproducible comparative analysis of taxonomic data and corresponding metadata in multiple programs remains a challenge in the investigation of microbial communities. PUMA, the Program for Unifying Microbiome Analysis, alleviates this problem in microbiome studies by allowing users to take advantage of numerous 16S rRNA taxonomic identification platforms and analysis tools in an efficient manner. PUMA accepts sequencing results from several taxonomic identification platforms and then automates configuration of data and file types for analysis and visualization via many popular tools. The protocol accomplishes this by producing a variety of properly configured, annotated, and altered files for both analysis and visualization of taxonomic community profiles and inferred functional profiles. PUMA provides an easy and flexible interface to accommodate for a variety of users to produce all files needed for all-inclusive analysis of targeted amplicon sequencing studies. PUMA is an unprecedented open-source solution for unifying multiple microbiome analysis softwares and uses an adaptable implementation with the potential to improve and consolidate the state of microbiome research.

This shortcoming leaves patterns of abundance, distribution, and diversity for the most abundant and diverse organisms on Earth without a predictive framework. However, because of their high abundance and complex dynamics, microbial communities may be underpinned by lognormal dynamics, i.e., synergistic interactions among complex stochastic variables. Using a global-scale compilation of 20,456 sites from a diverse set of natural and host-related environments, we test whether a lognormal model predicts microbial distributions of abundance and diversity-abundance scaling laws better than other well-known models, including the most successful macroecological theory of biodiversity, i.e., maximum entropy theory of ecology. We found that the lognormal explains the greatest percent variation in abundance, that the success of the lognormal increased with abundance while other models decreased, and that the lognormal was the only model to reproduce recently documented diversity-abundance scaling laws. Our unifying ecological theory of microbial biodiversity explains and predicts macroecological patterns based on dynamics that capture the complex large number dynamics of microbial life.","2016-06-08","2019-10-29 14:54:48","2019-10-30 12:26:03","2019-10-29 14:54:48","","","","","","","","","","","","PeerJ Preprints","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.7287/peerj.preprints.1450v3 Citation Key Alias: Shoemakerunifyingecologicaltheory2016","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/PSLWI9HB/Shoemaker et al_2016_A unifying ecological theory of microbial biodiversity.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Does early abundance spur long term persistence? How do deterministic and stochastic processes influence the roles of founder species? We performed a succession experiment within a hypersaline microbial mat ecosystem to investigate how ecological processes contributed to the turnover of founder species. Bacterial and micro-eukaryotic founder species were identified from primary succession and tracked through a defined maturation period using 16S and 18S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing in combination with high resolution imaging that utilized stable isotope tracers to evaluate basic functional capabilities. The majority of the founder species did not maintain high relative abundances in later stages of succession. Turnover (versus nestedness) was the dominant process shaping the final community structure. We also asked if different ecological processes acted on bacteria versus eukaryotes during successional stages and found that deterministic and stochastic forces corresponded more with eukaryote and bacterial colonization, respectively. Our results show that taxa from different kingdoms, that share habitat in the tight spatial confines of a biofilm, were influenced by different ecological forces and time scales of succession.","2018-03-15","2019-10-29 14:54:56","2019-10-30 12:21:53","2019-10-29 14:54:56","","","","","","","Forfeiting the founder effect","","","","","Ecology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/282574 Citation Key Alias: BrislawnForfeitingfoundereffect2018","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/PQGJ63WX/Brislawn et al_2018_Forfeiting the founder effect.pdf; /home/eror/Zotero/storage/H6GK4APJ/Brislawn et al_2018_Forfeiting the founder effect.pdf; /home/eror/Zotero/storage/AFL3RXB6/Brislawn et al_2018_Forfeiting the founder effect.pdf; /home/eror/Zotero/storage/LX3EEE4Q/Brislawn et al_2018_Forfeiting the founder effect.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, connecting microbial community composition to ecosystem function remains a challenge. Here, we introduce MICOM – a customizable metabolic model of the human gut microbiome. By using a heuristic optimization approach based on L2 regularization we were able to obtain a unique set of realistic growth rates that corresponded well with observed replication rates. We integrated adjustable dietary and taxon abundance constraints to generate personalized metabolic models for individual metagenomic samples. We applied MICOM to a balanced cohort of metagenomes from 186 people, including a metabolically healthy population and individuals with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Model results showed that individual bacterial genera maintained conserved niche structures across humans, while the community-level production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was heterogeneous and highly individual-specific. Model output revealed complex cross-feeding interactions that would be difficult to measure             in vivo             . Metabolic interaction networks differed somewhat consistently between healthy and diabetic subjects. In particular MICOM predicted reduced butyrate and propionate production in a diabetic cohort, with restoration of SCFA production profiles found in healthy subjects following metformin treatment. Overall, we found that changes in diet or taxon abundances have highly personalized effects. We believe MICOM can serve as a useful tool for generating mechanistic hypotheses for how diet and microbiome composition influence community function.

Aspiration of gastric contents is often implicated as a cause for these pulmonary complications, despite being supported by little evidence. The goal of this study is to determine the relative contribution of oropharyngeal and gastric microbial communities to perturbations in the lung microbiome of children with and without oropharyngeal dysphagia and aspiration.                                   1.2             Methods             We conducted a prospective cohort study of 220 patients consecutively recruited from a tertiary aerodigestive center undergoing simultaneous esophagogastroduodenoscopy and flexible bronchoscopy. Bronchoalveolar lavage, gastric and oropharyngeal samples were collected from all recruited patients and 16S sequencing was performed. A subset of 104 patients also underwent video fluoroscopic swallow studies to assess swallow function and were categorized as aspiration/no aspiration. To ensure the validity of the results, we compared the microbiome of these aerodigestive patients to the microbiome of pediatric patients recruited to a longitudinal cohort study of children with suspected GERD; patients recruited to this study had oropharyngeal, gastric and/or stool samples available. The relationships between microbial communities across the aerodigestive tract were described by analyzing within- and between-patient beta diversities and identifying taxa which are exchanged between aerodigestive sites within patients. These relationships were then compared in patients with and without aspiration to evaluate the effect of aspiration on the aerodigestive microbiome.                                   1.3             Results                            Within all patients, lung, oropharyngeal and gastric microbiomes overlap. The degree of similarity is the lowest between the oropharynx and lungs (median Jensen-Shannon distance (JSD) = 0.90), and as high between the stomach and lungs as between the oropharynx and stomach (median JSD = 0.56 for both; p = 0.6). Unlike the oropharyngeal microbiome, lung and gastric communities are highly variable across people and driven primarily by person rather than body site. In patients with aspiration, the lung microbiome more closely resembles oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities and there is greater prevalence of microbial exchange between the lung and oropharynx than between gastric and lung sites (p = 0.04 and 4×10               −5               , respectively).                                                1.4             Conclusions             The gastric and lung microbiomes display significant overlap in patients with intact airway protective mechanisms while the lung and oropharynx remain distinct. In patients with impaired swallow function and aspiration, the lung microbiome shifts towards oropharyngeal rather than gastric communities.

Stool samples are generally considered reference-standard but are not practical to obtain in the intensive care unit (ICU), and thus, rectal swabs are often used. However, the reliability of rectal swabs for gut microbiome profiling has not been established in the ICU setting. In this study, we compared 16S rRNA gene sequencing results between rectal swab and stool samples collected at three timepoints in mechanically-ventilated critically-ill adults. Rectal swabs comprised 89% of samples collected at the baseline timepoint, but stool samples became more available at later time-points. Significant differences in alpha and beta-diversity between rectal swabs and stool samples were observed, but these differences were primarily due to baseline samples. Higher relative abundance of Actinobacteria phyla (typically skin microbes) was present in rectal swabs compared to stool samples (p=0.05), a difference that was attenuated over time. The progressive similarity of rectal swabs and stool samples likely results from increasing stool coating of the rectal vault and direct soiling of the rectal swabs taken at later time points. Therefore, inferences about the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness should be drawn cautiously and take into account the actual type and timing of samples analyzed.                        Statement of Importance             Rectal swabs have been proposed as potential alternatives to stool samples for gut microbiome profiling in outpatients or healthy adults, but their reliability in critically-ill patients has not been defined. Because stool sampling is not practical and often not feasible in the intensive care unit, we performed a detailed comparison of gut microbial sequencing profiles between rectal swabs and stool samples in a longitudinal cohort of critically-ill patients. We identified systematic differences in gut microbial profiles between rectal swabs and stool samples and demonstrated that timing of rectal swab sampling had a significant impact on sequencing results. Our methodological findings should provide valuable information for the design and interpretation of future investigations of the role of the gut microbiome in critical illness.","2019-02-05","2019-10-30 10:15:40","2019-10-30 12:22:52","2019-10-30 10:15:40","","","","","","","Rectal swabs in critically-ill patients provide discordant representations of the gut microbiome compared to stool samples","","","","","Microbiology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/541441 Citation Key Alias: FairRectalswabscriticallyill2019a","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/J9HIK3ZH/Fair et al_2019_Rectal swabs in critically-ill patients provide discordant representations of.pdf","","human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the extent to which these proteins vary over time and between healthy subjects is poorly characterized. Here, we characterize technical and biological sources of variability in mass spectrometry-based measurements of host proteins in stool. We identify the proteins that most vary over time within an individual, and among different individuals. Finally, we examine and compare temporal and inter-individual variation in host protein and bacterial taxonomic profiles of the same fecal specimens. To address these issues, five self-reported healthy individuals were each sampled eight times over four weeks. First, we demonstrate that mass spectrometry-based identification and label-free quantification of stool proteins exhibit non-significant variability (p>0.05) between both technical and preparative replicates for a subset of 78 proteins, supporting the utility of this method for biomarker measurement. Second, although 13 human stool proteins varied significantly in relative abundance over time within individuals, 58 proteins varied significantly (at least four-fold) between subjects. The average pair-wise difference between individuals was greater than the average within-subject difference for both the proteome and microbiome datasets (p<0.0001). Fecal host proteins, like the traditional fecal protein marker, calprotectin, unambiguously pointed to innate and adaptive immune responses. For example, one subject’s fecal protein profile suggested a sub-clinical inflammatory state. From these data, we conclude that host-centric protein measurements in stool reveal a wide range of variation during states of apparent health, and add a valuable complementary insight into host-microbiota relationships.","2019-02-15","2019-10-30 10:15:45","2019-10-30 12:30:38","2019-10-30 10:15:45","","","","","","","","","","","","Molecular Biology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/551143 Citation Key Alias: CasavantStrategiesunderstandingdynamic2019a","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/IPSHJMNX/Casavant et al_2019_Strategies for understanding dynamic, personalized profiles of host-derived.pdf","","human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

High-throughput DNA sequencing technology (i.e., Next-generation Sequencing) has enabled the cost-effective, rapid assessment of microbial populations when combined with bioinformatic tools capable of identifying microbial taxa and calculating the diversity and composition of biological and environmental samples. Ribosomal RNA gene sequencing, where 16S and 18S rRNA gene sequences are used to identify prokaryotic and eukaryotic species, respectively, is one of the most widely-used techniques currently employed in microbiome analysis. Prior to bioinformatic analysis of these sequences, trimming parameters must be set so that post-trimming sequence information is maximized while expected errors in the sequences themselves are minimized. In this application note, we present FIGARO: a Python–based application designed to maximize read retention after trimming and filtering for quality. FIGARO was designed specifically to increase reproducibility and minimize trial-and-error in trimming parameter selection for a DADA2–based pipeline and will likely be useful for optimizing trimming parameters and minimizing sequence errors in other pipelines as well where paired-end overlap is required.

While human sources have been examined within single-family households or in public environments, it is unclear what effect a large number of cohabitating people have on the microbial communities of their shared environment. We sampled the public and private spaces of a college dormitory, disentangling individual microbial signatures and their impact on the microbiota of common spaces. We compared multiple methods for marker gene sequence clustering, and found that Minimum Entropy Decomposition (MED) was best able to distinguish between the microbial signatures of different individuals, and was able to uncover more discriminative taxa across all taxonomic groups. Further, weighted UniFrac- and random forest-based graph analyses uncovered two distinct spheres of hand or shoe associated samples. For hand-associated samples, connection between cliques was enriched for hands, implicating them as a primary means of transmission. By contrast, shoe-associated samples were found to be freely interacting, with individual shoes more connected to each other than to the floors they interact with. Individual interactions were highly dynamic, with groups of samples originating from individuals clustering freely with other individuals, while all floor and shoe samples consistently clustered together.                        Importance             Humans leave behind a microbial trail, regardless of intention. This may allow for the identification of individuals based on the ‘microbial signatures’ they shed in built environments. In a shared living environment, these trails intersect, and through interaction with common surfaces may become homogenized, potentially confounding our ability to link individuals to their associated microbiota. We sought to understand the factors that influence the mixing of individual signatures, and how best to process sequencing data to best tease apart these signatures.","2019-04-28","2019-10-30 10:16:05","2019-10-30 12:23:13","2019-10-30 10:16:05","","","","","","","","","","","","Ecology","","en","","preprint","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","DOI: 10.1101/620948 Citation Key Alias: RichardsonMicrobialSimilarityStudents2019a","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/KAPL9MB3/Richardson et al_2019_Microbial Similarity Between Students in a Common Dormitory Environment Reveals.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, analyzing the resulting multi-omics data and their correlations remains a significant challenge in current studies due to the lack of a comprehensive computational tool to facilitate data integration and interpretation. In this study, we have developed a microbiome and metabolome integrative analysis pipeline (M2IA) to meet the urgent needs for tools that effectively integrate microbiome and metabolome data to derive biological insights. Results: M2IA streamlines the integrative data analysis between metabolome and microbiome, including both univariate analysis and multivariate modeling methods. KEGG-based functional analysis of microbiome and metabolome are provided to explore their biological interactions within specific metabolic pathways. The functionality of M2IA was demonstrated using TwinsUK cohort data with 1116 fecal metabolites and 16s rRNA microbiome from 786 individuals. As a result, we identified two important pathways, i.e., the benzoate degradation and phosphotransferase system, were closely associated with obesity from both metabolome and microbiome. Conclusions: M2IA is a public available web server (http://m2ia.met-bioinformatics.cn) with the capability to investigate the complex interplay between microbiome and metabolome, and help users to develop mechanistic hypothesis for nutritional and personalized therapies of diseases.

We found that primary resistance to ICIs can be attributed to abnormal gut microbiome composition. Antibiotics inhibited the clinical benefit of ICIs in patients with advanced cancer. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from cancer patients who responded to ICIs into germ-free or antibiotic-treated mice ameliorated the antitumor effects of PD-1 blockade, whereas FMT from nonresponding patients failed to do so.

Here we use the Komodo dragon (               Varanus komodoensis               ) to quantify the degree of sharing of salivary, skin, and fecal microbiota with their environment in captivity. Both species richness and microbial community composition of most surfaces in the Komodo dragon’s environment are similar to the Komodo dragon’s salivary and skin microbiota but less similar to the stool-associated microbiota. We additionally compared host-environment microbiome sharing between captive Komodo dragons and their enclosures, humans and pets and their homes, and wild amphibians and their environments. We observed similar host-environment microbiome sharing patterns among humans and their pets and Komodo dragons, with high levels of human/pet- and Komodo dragon-associated microbes on home and enclosure surfaces. In contrast, only small amounts of amphibian-associated microbes were detected in the animals’ environments. We suggest that the degree of sharing between the Komodo dragon microbiota and its enclosure surfaces has important implications for animal health. These animals evolved in the context of constant exposure to a complex environmental microbiota, which likely shaped their physiological development; in captivity, these animals will not receive significant exposure to microbes not already in their enclosure, with unknown consequences for their health.                                         IMPORTANCE               Animals, including humans, have evolved in the context of exposure to a variety of microbial organisms present in the environment. Only recently have humans, and some animals, begun to spend a significant amount of time in enclosed artificial environments, rather than in the more natural spaces in which most of evolution took place. The consequences of this radical change in lifestyle likely extend to the microbes residing in and on our bodies and may have important implications for health and disease. A full characterization of host-microbe sharing in both closed and open environments will provide crucial information that may enable the improvement of health in humans and in captive animals, both of which experience a greater incidence of disease (including chronic illness) than counterparts living under more ecologically natural conditions.","2016-08-30","2019-10-30 10:18:19","2019-10-30 10:18:19","2019-10-30 10:18:19","e00046-16, /msys/1/4/e00046-16.atom","","4","1","","mSystems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/DYAR2EG6/Hyde et al_2016_The Oral and Skin Microbiomes of Captive Komodo Dragons Are Significantly.pdf","","","","Shade, Ashley","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, we leveraged genomes from metagenomes to investigate how genes of the premature infant gut resistome correspond to the ability of bacteria to survive under certain environmental and clinical conditions. We found that formula feeding impacts the resistome. Random forest models corroborated by statistical tests revealed that the gut resistome of formula-fed infants is enriched in class D beta-lactamase genes. Interestingly,               Clostridium difficile               strains harboring this gene are at higher abundance in formula-fed infants than               C. difficile               strains lacking this gene. Organisms with genes for major facilitator superfamily drug efflux pumps have higher replication rates under all conditions, even in the absence of antibiotic therapy. Using a machine learning approach, we identified genes that are predictive of an organism’s direction of change in relative abundance after administration of vancomycin and cephalosporin antibiotics. The most accurate results were obtained by reducing annotated genomic data to five principal components classified by boosted decision trees. Among the genes involved in predicting whether an organism increased in relative abundance after treatment are those that encode subclass B2 beta-lactamases and transcriptional regulators of vancomycin resistance. This demonstrates that machine learning applied to genome-resolved metagenomics data can identify key genes for survival after antibiotics treatment and predict how organisms in the gut microbiome will respond to antibiotic administration.

However, identifying the microbial taxa that differentiate these samples can be challenging. These issues stem from the compositional nature of 16S rRNA gene data (or, more generally, taxon or functional gene data); the changes in the relative abundance of one taxon influence the apparent abundances of the others. Here we acknowledge that inferring properties of individual bacteria is a difficult problem and instead introduce the concept of balances to infer meaningful properties of subcommunities, rather than properties of individual species. We show that balances can yield insights about niche differentiation across multiple microbial environments, including soil environments and lung sputum. These techniques have the potential to reshape how we carry out future ecological analyses aimed at revealing differences in relative taxonomic abundances across different samples.

The forces controlling desert ecosystem degradation rates are poorly understood, particularly with respect to the relevance of the arid-soil microbiome. Here we document correlations between increasing aridity and soil bacterial and archaeal microbiome composition along arid to hyperarid transects traversing the Atacama Desert, Chile. A meta-analysis reveals that Atacama soil microbiomes exhibit a gradient in composition, are distinct from a broad cross-section of nondesert soils, and yet are similar to three deserts from different continents. Community richness and diversity were significantly positively correlated with soil relative humidity (SoilRH). Phylogenetic composition was strongly correlated with SoilRH, temperature, and electrical conductivity. The strongest and most significant correlations between SoilRH and phylum relative abundance were observed for               Acidobacteria               ,               Proteobacteria               ,               Planctomycetes               ,               Verrucomicrobia               , and               Euryarchaeota               (Spearman’s rank correlation [               r               s               ] = >0.81; false-discovery rate [               q               ] = ≤0.005), characterized by 10- to 300-fold decreases in the relative abundance of each taxon. In addition, network analysis revealed a deterioration in the density of significant associations between taxa along the arid to hyperarid gradient, a pattern that may compromise the resilience of hyperarid communities because they lack properties associated with communities that are more integrated. In summary, results suggest that arid-soil microbiome stability is sensitive to aridity as demonstrated by decreased community connectivity associated with the transition from the arid class to the hyperarid class and the significant correlations observed between soilRH and both diversity and the relative abundances of key microbial phyla typically dominant in global soils.                                         IMPORTANCE               We identify key environmental and geochemical factors that shape the arid soil microbiome along aridity and vegetation gradients spanning over 300 km of the Atacama Desert, Chile. Decreasing average soil relative humidity and increasing temperature explain significant reductions in the diversity and connectivity of these desert soil microbial communities and lead to significant reductions in the abundance of key taxa typically associated with fertile soils. This finding is important because it suggests that predicted climate change-driven increases in aridity may compromise the capacity of the arid-soil microbiome to sustain necessary nutrient cycling and carbon sequestration functions as well as vegetative cover in desert ecosystems, which comprise one-third of the terrestrial biomes on Earth.","2017-06-27","2019-10-30 10:18:45","2019-10-30 10:18:45","2019-10-30 10:18:45","e00195-16, /msys/2/3/e00195-16.atom","","3","2","","mSystems","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/R2WLBQBH/Neilson et al_2017_Significant Impacts of Increasing Aridity on the Arid Soil Microbiome.pdf","","","","Chu, Haiyan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The impact of ocean acidification and carbonation on microbial community structure was assessed during a large-scale in situ costal pelagic mesocosm study, included as part of the EPOCA 2010 Arctic campaign. The mesocosm experiment included ambient conditions (fjord) and nine mesocosms with pCO2 levels ranging from ~145 to ~1420 μatm. Samples for the present study were collected at ten time points (t–1, t1, t5, t7, t12, t14, t18, t22, t26 to t28) in seven treatments (ambient fjord (~145), 2 × ~185, ~270, ~685, ~820, ~1050 μatm) and were analysed for ""small"" and ""large"" size fraction microbial community composition using 16S RNA (ribosomal ribonucleic acid) amplicon sequencing. This high-throughput sequencing analysis produced ~20 000 000 16S rRNA V4 reads, which comprised 7000 OTUs. The main variables structuring these communities were sample origins (fjord or mesocosms) and the community size fraction (small or large size fraction). The community was significantly different between the unenclosed fjord water and enclosed mesocosms (both control and elevated CO2 treatments) after nutrients were added to the mesocosms, suggesting that the addition of nutrients is the primary driver of the change in mesocosm community structure. The relative importance of each structuring variable depended greatly on the time at which the community was sampled in relation to the phytoplankton bloom. The sampling strategy of separating the small and large size fraction was the second most important factor for community structure. When the small and large size fraction bacteria were analysed separately at different time points, the only taxon pCO2 was found to significantly affect were the Gammaproteobacteria after nutrient addition. Finally, pCO2 treatment was found to be significantly correlated (non-linear) with 15 rare taxa, most of which increased in abundance with higher CO2.","2013-01-29","2019-10-30 10:29:04","2019-10-30 10:29:04","2019-10-30 10:29:04","555-566","","1","10","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/D26IX29Y/Roy et al_2013_Ocean acidification shows negligible impacts on high-latitude bacterial.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In drylands, microbes that colonize rock surfaces have been linked to erosion because water scarcity excludes traditional weathering mechanisms. We studied the origin and role of rock biofilms in geomorphic processes of hard lime and dolomitic rocks that feature comparable weathering morphologies, although these two rock types originate from arid and hyperarid environments, respectively. We hypothesized that weathering patterns are fashioned by salt erosion and mediated by the rock biofilms that originate from the adjacent soil and dust. We used a combination of microbial and geological techniques to characterize rock morphologies and the origin and diversity of their biofilms. Amplicon sequencing of the SSU rRNA gene suggested that bacterial diversity is low and dominated by Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria. These phyla only formed laminar biofilms on rock surfaces that were exposed to the atmosphere and burrowed up to 6 mm beneath the surface, protected by sedimentary deposits. Unexpectedly, the microbial composition of the biofilms differed between the two rock types and was also distinct from the communities identified in the adjacent soil and settled dust, showing a habitat-specific filtering effect. Moreover, the rock bacterial communities were shown to secrete extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) that form an evaporation barrier, reducing water loss rates by 65 %–75 %. The reduced water transport rates through the rock also limit salt transport and its crystallization in surface pores, which is thought to be the main force for weathering. Concomitantly, the biofilm layer stabilizes the rock surface via coating and protects the weathered front. Our hypothesis contradicts common models, which typically consider biofilms to be agents that promote weathering. In contrast, we propose that the microbial colonization of mineral surfaces acts to mitigate geomorphic processes in hot, arid environments.","2019-03-19","2019-10-30 10:29:07","2019-10-30 10:29:07","2019-10-30 10:29:07","1133-1145","","6","16","","Biogeosciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/8FB5NGFC/Wieler et al_2019_The origin and role of biological rock crusts in rocky desert weathering.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For large, diverse microbial communities, prediction of these capabilities is limited by uncertainty about metabolic functions and environmental conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a probabilistic method, inspired by percolation theory, to computationally quantify how robustly a genome-derived metabolic network produces a given set of metabolites under an ensemble of variable environments. We used this method to compile an atlas of predicted biosynthetic capabilities for 97 metabolites across 456 human oral microbes. This atlas captures taxonomically-related trends in biomass composition, and makes it possible to estimate inter-microbial metabolic distances that correlate with microbial co-occurrences. We also found a distinct cluster of fastidious/uncultivated taxa, including several Saccharibacteria (TM7) species, characterized by their abundant metabolic deficiencies. By embracing uncertainty, our approach can be broadly applied to understanding metabolic interactions in complex microbial ecosystems.","2019-06-13","2019-10-30 10:29:43","2019-10-30 12:30:38","2019-10-30 10:29:43","e39733","","","8","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/UF83I3ZN/Bernstein et al_2019_Metabolic network percolation quantifies biosynthetic capabilities across the.pdf","","human","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The skin microbiome is thought to play important roles in skin defence and immune functioning. Diabetes affects the skin environment, and this may perturb skin microbiome with possible implications for skin infections and wound healing. This study examines the skin and wound microbiome in type II diabetes.                                         Methods               Eight type II diabetic subjects with chronic foot ulcers were followed over a time course of 10 weeks, sampling from both foot skin (swabs) and wounds (swabs and debrided tissue) every two weeks. A control group of eight control subjects was also followed over 10 weeks, and skin swabs collected from the foot skin every two weeks. Samples were processed for DNA and subject to 16S rRNA gene PCR and sequencing of the V4 region.                                         Results                                The diabetic skin microbiome was significantly less diverse than control skin. Community composition was also significantly different between diabetic and control skin, however the most abundant taxa were similar between groups, with differences driven by very low abundant members of the skin communities. Chronic wounds tended to be dominated by the most abundant skin                 Staphylococcus                 , while other abundant wound taxa differed by patient. No significant correlations were found between wound duration or healing status and the abundance of any particular taxa.                                                        Discussion               The major difference observed in this study of the skin microbiome associated with diabetes was a significant reduction in diversity. The long-term effects of reduced diversity are not yet well understood, but are often associated with disease conditions.","2017-07-20","2019-10-30 10:29:52","2019-10-30 10:29:52","2019-10-30 10:29:52","e3543","","","5","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/home/eror/Zotero/storage/WEFK3VUK/Gardiner et al_2017_A longitudinal study of the diabetic skin and wound microbiome.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
